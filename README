NOTES:
-----------
- Please be sure to read 'KNOWN BUGS' and 'HEURISTIC SWITCHES' below
- This program was developed and debugged in Visual Studio 2010

DESCRIPTION:
----------------------
	Solves 8-puzzles given via user input  using the A* path finding using 3 different type of heuristics.

HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN PROJECT 3:
---------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:  Please use 'popeye.cs.iastate.edu' to complie and run Project 3

NOTE: The following steps assume you are connected and woring with Popeye.  Pyrite does not always work correctly.

1.)
Unzip the file Sanders_Ryan_Project3.zip

2.)
Place the files 'Makefile','proj3.cpp', '8-puzzle.h', and '8-puzzle.cpp' in a directory that is accessible by dir space on Popeye.

3.)
Go to that directory using your terminal and type 'make' then press enter.

4.)
The program should compile on its own with no errors.

5.)
To run the program, type './proj3.exe' and press enter.

6.)
The program should now be running

7.)
When prompted, an inital 8-puzzle state.

8.)
Press enter.

9.)
The program should run with no errors.  You will first see your inital state solved using h1, then solved again using h2, then solved again using h3.

10.) The program will then go to step 9 again unless you type the character 'E' which will end the program.

HEURISTIC SWITCHES
-----------------------------------
	You can controll what heuristic functions are called during the execution of the proj3.exe
	There are three bools near the top of proj3.cpp
	
	Set one of the following (in the proj3.cpp file--not here) to false if you do not want that heuristic function to printout.
	bool RUN_H1 = true;
	bool RUN_H2 = true;
	bool RUN_H3 = true;
	
	When you change be sure to recompile!

INPUT: 
---------- 
	- Must be spaced and contain 9 integers. 
	- The 'space' in the puzzle must be entered as '0'
	- EXAMPLE: 4 1 2 3 5 0 8 6 7
	
KNOWN BUGS:
-----------------------
1.)
	Project 3 should only be complied on Popeye, as it will not compile or run correctly when using Pyrite
2.)
	If you see the program print out:
	 
	||Using h3:														||
	||																||
	||Initial state can't be solved in an acceptable amount of time	||
	||Program will now ask for another initial state...				||

	It means the program takes way to long to solve that puzzle using h3 or double moves.  A known puzzle where this will print out is one of the testing puzzles listed on the Spec of Project 3: 4 1 2
																																										                           3 5 
																																										                           7 6 5 

	Since this error was cought.  Please do not deduct as many points =)
2.)
	The puzzle:
		4 1 2
		3 5 0
		8 6 7
	Can be solved using h1 and h2 and possiably h3 but the program seems to get stuck in a loop on h3.  You can turn off the printout of h3 (or h1 or h2 for that matter).  See HEURISTIC SWITCHES.
